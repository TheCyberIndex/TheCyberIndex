        <h2>Introduction to OSINT</h2>
        <p>Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) involves collecting publicly available information from a wide range of sources to support cybersecurity investigations, ethical hacking, and research. This process is crucial in the reconnaissance phase of penetration testing, where understanding a target's digital footprint is key to identifying potential vulnerabilities. OSINT allows security professionals to gather valuable data, such as personal details, domain registration information, exposed assets, network configurations, and even leaked credentials, which can be used to build a profile of the target. By leveraging search engines, social media, domain lookup services, and publicly accessible databases, OSINT provides insight into potential weaknesses that may not be visible through direct scanning or active probing. This passive reconnaissance is highly effective in reducing unknowns about a target's infrastructure, network topology, or organizational structure, enabling better planning and precision in penetration tests or cybersecurity defenses. Effective OSINT helps identify security gaps, such as unpatched systems, exposed APIs, and improperly configured services, which can be mitigated before adversaries exploit them.</p>
