        <h1>Password Cracking</h1>
    </header>
    <section class="content">
        <h2>Password Cracking</h2>
        <p>Password cracking is the process of recovering passwords from data that has been stored or transmitted in a system by exploiting weak password security measures. This practice is widely used in cybersecurity for both ethical hacking and malicious attacks. Tools such as <strong>Hashcat</strong> and <strong>John the Ripper</strong> are commonly employed to perform brute force, dictionary, and hybrid attacks on hashed passwords, revealing the original password in the process. Password cracking plays a critical role in penetration testing, where ethical hackers test the strength of an organizationâ€™s password policies, or during investigations in digital forensics. While password cracking serves an essential purpose in identifying vulnerabilities, it must always be performed in a legal and controlled environment with the consent of the system owner to avoid ethical and legal violations.</p>
    
        <h2>Installing Password Cracking Tools</h2>
        <p>To begin, we need to install popular password cracking tools such as Hashcat and John the Ripper. These tools are essential for performing password attacks in a controlled and ethical manner.</p>
        <div class="terminal">
            <pre>sudo apt-get install hashcat
sudo apt-get install john</pre>
        </div>

        <h2>Using Wordlists for Password Cracking</h2>
        <p>Password cracking tools often require wordlists to attempt multiple password combinations. The most commonly used wordlist is <code>rockyou.txt</code>, which can be found in <code>/usr/share/wordlists</code>:</p>
        <div class="terminal">
            <pre>cd /usr/share/wordlists/</pre>
        </div>
        <p>If the wordlist is not available, you can download it manually:</p>
        <div class="terminal">
            <pre>sudo wget https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/wordlists/-/raw/kali/master/rockyou.txt.gz -P /usr/share/wordlists/</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Once downloaded, unzip the file:</p>
        <div class="terminal">
            <pre>sudo gzip -d /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz</pre>
        </div>

        <h2>Preparing Hashes for Cracking</h2>
        <p>Before using a password cracking tool, you need to have the hash of the password that you want to crack. To create a file containing a hash, use the following command:</p>
        <div class="terminal">
            <pre>echo "hash_value_here" > hash.txt</pre>
        </div>
        <p>If you need to add multiple hashes to one file:</p>
        <div class="terminal">
            <pre>echo "another_hash_value" >> hash.txt</pre>
        </div>
        <p>You can also use a text editor like nano to paste multiple hashes manually:</p>
        <div class="terminal">
            <pre>nano hash.txt</pre>
        </div>

        <h2>Cracking Passwords with Hashcat</h2>
        <p>Hashcat is one of the most powerful and versatile password-cracking tools available. It supports a wide range of hash types and cracking modes, allowing penetration testers and ethical hackers to break passwords using different approaches. Below, we'll go through the steps for using Hashcat, including how to prepare for a cracking session, the different attack modes, and best practices to optimize your cracking efforts.</p>

        <h3>Introduction to Hashcat</h3>
        <p>Hashcat is a command-line tool that utilizes the processing power of GPUs to crack password hashes. Hashes are cryptographic representations of passwords, and Hashcat allows users to reverse these hashes back to plain text passwords using brute force and dictionary attacks. Hashcat supports a large number of hashing algorithms, including MD5, SHA1, bcrypt, NTLM, and more.</p>

        <h3>Preparing for Hash Cracking</h3>
        <p>Before using Hashcat, you need a few components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A Hash File:</strong> This is the file containing the hash or hashes you want to crack. Hashes can be captured from databases or sniffed during penetration testing engagements.</li>
            <li><strong>A Wordlist:</strong> A wordlist is a file containing potential passwords that Hashcat will use to attempt to crack the hash. A popular wordlist is the <code>rockyou.txt</code>, which can be found in <code>/usr/share/wordlists/</code> in most Linux distributions.</li>
            <li><strong>Hashcat Installed:</strong> Install Hashcat by running <code>sudo apt install hashcat</code> in your Linux terminal.</li>
            <li><strong>Identifying the Hash Type:</strong> Before attempting to crack the hash, it's crucial to identify its type. Different hashing algorithms require different Hashcat modes. You can use the tool <code>hashid</code> to identify the hash type. Install hashid by running <code>sudo apt install hashid</code>. After installation, identify your hash type with the following command:</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="terminal">
            <pre>hashid -m &lt;hash_value&gt;</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This will return a list of possible hash types and modes that Hashcat can use for cracking.</p>

        <h3>Hashcat Attack Modes</h3>
        <p>Hashcat provides different attack modes that determine how passwords are attempted. Some of the common attack modes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dictionary Attack (Mode 0):</strong> This attack mode tries passwords from a wordlist, one by one, against the hash. It is useful for cracking weak passwords.</li>
            <li><strong>Brute Force Attack (Mode 3):</strong> This attack mode generates passwords by attempting all possible combinations of characters. It can be very time-consuming but guarantees that if the password is within the specified character set and length, it will be found.</li>
            <li><strong>Combination Attack (Mode 1):</strong> This attack mode combines words from two different wordlists, creating new candidate passwords by appending words together.</li>
            <li><strong>Rule-Based Attack:</strong> This is one of the most advanced attacks in Hashcat, allowing users to apply specific rules to wordlists in order to generate password variations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cracking an MD5 Hash Using Hashcat</h3>
        <p>To crack a hash using Hashcat, follow these steps. In the following example, we will crack an MD5 hash using a dictionary attack:</p>

        <h4>Command to Crack an MD5 Hash</h4>
        <p>Use the following command to start cracking:</p>
        <div class="terminal">
            <pre>hashcat -m &lt;hash_type&gt; -a 0 &lt;hash_file&gt; /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt</pre>
        </div>
        <p>For example, to crack an MD5 hash (hash type <code>-m 0</code>), use:</p>
        <div class="terminal">
            <pre>hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Explanation of parameters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>-m 0</code>: Specifies the hash type (MD5 in this case).</li>
            <li><code>-a 0</code>: Specifies the attack mode (Dictionary attack).</li>
            <li><code>hash.txt</code>: The file containing the hash to be cracked.</li>
            <li><code>/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt</code>: The wordlist file to use for cracking.</li>
        </ul>

        <div>
            <p><strong>Different hashing algorithms:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MD5 (-m 0):</strong> One of the most commonly used hashing algorithms. However, it is considered weak due to its vulnerability to collision attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>SHA1 (-m 100):</strong> A widely-used hashing algorithm that is stronger than MD5 but still vulnerable to attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>SHA256 (-m 1400):</strong> A secure hash function that is commonly used in many security protocols and applications.</li>
                <li><strong>bcrypt (-m 3200):</strong> A password hashing function designed to be slow to make brute-force attacks difficult.</li>
                <li><strong>NTLM (-m 1000):</strong> A hash type used in Windows systems for storing password data.</li>
                <li><strong>SHA512 (-m 1700):</strong> A stronger version of the SHA family, offering better protection against brute-force attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>LM (-m 3000):</strong> LAN Manager hash, used in older Windows systems. It is highly vulnerable and should not be used.</li>
                <li><strong>WPA/WPA2 (-m 2500):</strong> Hash type used for cracking Wi-Fi network passwords (handshake files).</li>
                <li><strong>PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1 (-m 12000):</strong> A key derivation function commonly used for securing passwords in applications.</li>
                <li><strong>MD5(Unix) (-m 500):</strong> MD5-based password hashing used by Unix systems.</li>
                <li><strong>SHA1(Unix) (-m 1500):</strong> SHA1-based password hashing used by Unix systems.</li>
                <li><strong>SHA256(Unix) (-m 7400):</strong> SHA256-based password hashing used by Unix systems.</li>
                <li><strong>SHA512(Unix) (-m 1800):</strong> SHA512-based password hashing used by Unix systems.</li>
                <li><strong>MySQL323 (-m 200):</strong> Hashing method used in older versions of MySQL for password storage.</li>
                <li><strong>MySQL5 (-m 300):</strong> Hashing method used in newer versions of MySQL for password storage.</li>
                <li><strong>Oracle 11g (-m 112):</strong> Hash type used for password storage in Oracle 11g databases.</li>
                <li><strong>Office 2007 (-m 9400):</strong> Hash type used for Microsoft Office 2007 document encryption.</li>
                <li><strong>Office 2013 (-m 9600):</strong> Hash type used for Microsoft Office 2013 document encryption.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>To crack a hash, specify the appropriate hash type by using the <code>-m</code> flag followed by the correct mode number. For example, to crack an NTLM hash, use:</p>
        <div class="terminal">
            <pre>hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt</pre>
        </div>

        <p>Be sure to consult the <a href="https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=hashcat">official Hashcat documentation</a> for a comprehensive list of supported hash types and their corresponding mode numbers.</p>

            Hydra works by performing a dictionary attack against login credentials for various services. This means it tries a list of potential usernames and passwords to find valid combinations. Hydra is highly customizable and supports many different protocols, including SSH, FTP, HTTP, and more. To use Hydra effectively, it's essential to understand the syntax and options available.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Hydra Usage Examples</h2>
        <h4>Cracking SSH Passwords</h4>
        <p>
            To use Hydra for cracking SSH passwords, you need a target IP address, a username (or list of usernames), and a wordlist containing potential passwords. Here is an example command:
        </p>
        <div class="terminal">
            <pre>hydra -l username -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.1.100</pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            In this command:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>-l username</code>: Specifies the username to try. You can also use <code>-L</code> followed by a file to try multiple usernames.</li>
            <li><code>-P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt</code>: Specifies the wordlist to use for password attempts.</li>
            <li><code>ssh://192.168.1.100</code>: Specifies the target service (SSH) and IP address.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cracking FTP Passwords</h2>
        <p>
            Hydra can also be used to attack FTP services. To attempt password cracking for FTP, use the following command:
        </p>
        <div class="terminal">
            <pre>hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ftp://192.168.1.200</pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            This command will try the <code>admin</code> username with each password in the specified wordlist against the target FTP server.
        </p>

        <h2>Cracking HTTP Login Forms</h2>
        <p>
            To use Hydra for cracking a password-protected web page, you need to provide information about the HTTP form. Here's an example command:
        </p>
        <div class="terminal">
            <pre>hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.1.150 http-post-form "/login.php:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:F=incorrect"</pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            Explanation:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>-l admin</code>: Username to use (can also use <code>-L</code> for a list of usernames).</li>
            <li><code>-P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt</code>: Wordlist for password attempts.</li>
            <li><code>http-post-form</code>: Specifies the type of HTTP request (in this case, POST).</li>
            <li><code>"/login.php:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:F=incorrect"</code>: Defines the form fields and failure message. Replace <code>incorrect</code> with the message the server shows on failed login attempts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Using Hydra with SSH</h2>
        <p>Hydra is capable of cracking SSH passwords, which is a common target in penetration tests. Below, we'll cover how to perform a password attack against an SSH server using Hydra:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Target IP address or hostname:</strong> The address of the server you want to test.</li>
            <li><strong>Username or username list:</strong> You can use a single username or a file containing multiple usernames.</li>
            <li><strong>Password list:</strong> A wordlist containing possible passwords. Common wordlists include <code>rockyou.txt</code>, found in <code>/usr/share/wordlists/</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5>Execute the Hydra Command</h5>
        <p>Use the following command to run Hydra against SSH:</p>
        <div class="terminal">
            <pre>hydra -l username -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.1.100</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Explanation of command components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>-l username</code>: The username you want to use. Replace <code>username</code> with the actual name you wish to target.</li>
            <li><code>-P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt</code>: The path to the wordlist containing possible passwords. In this example, we use the <code>rockyou.txt</code> wordlist.</li>
            <li><code>ssh://192.168.1.100</code>: Specifies the target protocol (SSH) and the IP address of the target machine.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5>Review the Results</h5>
        <p>Once the attack is launched, Hydra will try all the passwords in the wordlist for the specified username. If successful, Hydra will display the cracked password.</p>
        <div class="terminal">
            <pre>
        [22][ssh] host: 192.168.1.100   login: admin   password: 123456
            </pre>
        </div>
        
        <p>If the password is cracked, it will be shown in the format indicating the IP address, login, and password. Always remember to stop once you have gathered sufficient information to achieve your objective during a penetration test.</p>
        
        <h5>Important Considerations</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rate Limiting:</strong> SSH servers often have rate-limiting measures in place to prevent rapid password attempts. To avoid triggering alarms or blocking your IP, use the <code>-t</code> flag to set the number of parallel connections. Example: <code>-t 4</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Lockouts:</strong> Many systems lock accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts. Be aware of the risk of locking legitimate users out of their accounts when using Hydra.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Hydra is a powerful tool and should only be used ethically and with proper authorization. Unauthorized access is illegal and can lead to severe consequences.</p>
