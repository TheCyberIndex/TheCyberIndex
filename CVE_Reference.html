            <div class="owasp-item-header">A01:2021 - Broken Access Control</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-6727:</strong> A flaw in versions of Delphix Data Control Tower (DCT) prior to 19.0.0 results in broken authentication through the enable-scale-testing functionality of the application.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-6428:</strong> Mattermost versions 9.8.0, 9.7.x <= 9.7.4, 9.6.x <= 9.6.2, 9.5.x <= 9.5.5 fail to prevent specifying a RemoteId when creating a new user which allows an attacker to specify both a remoteId and the user ID, resulting in creating a user with a user-defined user ID. This can cause some broken functionality in User Management such administrative actions against the user not working.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-5559:</strong> CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm vulnerability exists that could cause denial of service, device reboot, or an attacker gaining full control of the relay when a specially crafted reset token is entered into the front panel of the device.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-4263:</strong> A broken access control vulnerability exists in mlflow/mlflow versions before 2.10.1, where low privilege users with only EDIT permissions on an experiment can delete any artifacts. This issue arises due to the lack of proper validation for DELETE requests by users with EDIT permissions, allowing them to perform unauthorized deletions of artifacts. The vulnerability specifically affects the handling of artifact deletions within the application, as demonstrated by the ability of a low privilege user to delete a directory inside an artifact using a DELETE request, despite the official documentation stating that users with EDIT permission can only read and update artifacts, not delete them.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-40480:</strong>A Broken Access Control vulnerability was found in /admin/update.php and /admin/dashboard.php in Kashipara Online Exam System v1.0, which allows remote unauthenticated attackers to view administrator dashboard and delete valid user accounts via the direct URL access.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-39701:</strong>Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Directus >=9.23.0, <=v10.5.3 improperly handles _in, _nin operators. It evaluates empty arrays as valid so expressions like {"role": {"_in": $CURRENT_USER.some_field}} would evaluate to true allowing the request to pass. This results in Broken Access Control because the rule fails to do what it was intended to do: Pass rule if **field** matches any of the **values**. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.6.0.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-38475:</strong>Improper escaping of output in mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are permitted to be served by the server but are not intentionally/directly reachable by any URL, resulting in code execution or source code disclosure. Substitutions in server context that use a backreferences or variables as the first segment of the substitution are affected. Some unsafe RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag "UnsafePrefixStat" can be used to opt back in once ensuring the substitution is appropriately constrained.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-36496:</strong>The configuration file is encrypted with a static key derived from a static five-character password which allows an attacker to decrypt this file. The application hashes this five-character password with the outdated and broken MD5 algorithm (no salt) and uses the first five bytes as the key for RC4. The configuration file is then encrypted with these parameters.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-35670:</strong>Broken Authentication vulnerability in SoftLab Integrate Google Drive.This issue affects Integrate Google Drive: from n/a through 1.3.93.</li>

This issue may allow an attacker to trigger memory allocation failures through certain means, such as restricting the heap space size or injecting faults, causing a segmentation fault. This can cause an application crash, eventually leading to a denial of service.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-6472:</strong> Certificate Validation user interface in LibreOffice allows potential vulnerability. Signed macros are scripts that have been digitally signed by the developer using a cryptographic signature. When a document with a signed macro is opened a warning is displayed by LibreOffice before the macro is executed. Previously if verification failed the user could fail to understand the failure and choose to enable the macros anyway. This issue affects LibreOffice: from 24.2 before 24.2.5.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-6162:</strong> A vulnerability was found in Undertow, where URL-encoded request paths can be mishandled during concurrent requests on the AJP listener. This issue arises because the same buffer is used to decode the pathsHere is the continuation and completion of the revised HTML and CSS with all formatting and display issues fixed: simultaneously, leading to incorrect path information being processed. As a result, the server may attempt to access the wrong path, causing errors such as "404 Not Found" or other application failures. This flaw can potentially lead to a denial of service, as legitimate resources become inaccessible due to the path mix-up.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-6127:</strong> BC Security Empire before 5.9.3 is vulnerable to a path traversal issue that can lead to remote code execution. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability over HTTP by acting as a normal agent, completing all cryptographic handshakes, and then triggering an upload of payload data containing a malicious path.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-5559:</strong> CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm vulnerability exists that could cause denial of service, device reboot, or an attacker gaining full control of the relay when a specially crafted reset token is entered into the front panel of the device.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-5296:</strong> D-Link D-View Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key Authentication Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of D-Link D-View. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the TokenUtils class. The issue results from a hard-coded cryptographic key. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-21991.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-5273:</strong> Jenkins Report Info Plugin 1.2 and earlier does not perform path validation of the workspace directory while serving report files, allowing attackers with Item/Configure permission to retrieve Surefire failures, PMD violations, Findbugs bugs, and Checkstyle errors on the controller file system by editing the workspace path.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-4563:</strong> The Progress MOVEit Automation configuration export function prior to 2024.0.0 uses a cryptographic method with insufficient bit length.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-42475:</strong> In the OAuth library for nim prior to version 0.11, the `state` values generated by the `generateState` function do not have sufficient entropy. These can be successfully guessed by an attacker allowing them to perform a CSRF vs a user, associating the user's session with the attacker's protected resources. While `state` isn't exactly a cryptographic value, it should be generated in a cryptographically secure way. `generateState` should be using a CSPRNG. Version 0.11 modifies the `generateState` function to generate `state` values of at least 128 bits of entropy while using a CSPRNG.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-42229:</strong> In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: crypto: aead,cipher - zeroize key buffer after use I.G 9.7.B for FIPS 140-3 specifies that variables temporarily holding cryptographic information should be zeroized once they are no longer needed. Accomplish this by using kfree_sensitive for buffers that previously held the private key.</li>

                <li><strong>CVE-2024-2999:</strong> A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Campcodes Online Art Gallery Management System 1.0. This affects an unknown part of the file /admin/adminHome.php. The manipulation of the argument uname leads to sql injection. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier VDB-258201 was assigned to this vulnerability.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-3056:</strong> A flaw was found in Podman. This issue may allow an attacker to create a specially crafted container that, when configured to share the same IPC with at least one other container, can create a large number of IPC resources in /dev/shm. The malicious container will continue to exhaust resources until it is out-of-memory (OOM) killed. While the malicious container's cgroup will be removed, the IPC resources it created are not. Those resources are tied to the IPC namespace that will not be removed until all containers using it are stopped, and one non-malicious container is holding the namespace open. The malicious container is restarted, either automatically or by attacker control, repeating the process and increasing the amount of memory consumed. With a container configured to restart always, such as `podman run --restart=always`, this can result in a memory-based denial of service of the system.</li>
                <li><strong>CVE-2024-3123:</strong> CHANGING Mobile One Time Password's uploading function in a hidden page does not filter file type properly.
